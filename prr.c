// Question#6: 
//An analog clock is a tool for reading the time of day. The shortest clock needle 
// indicates the hour, a longer needle indicates the minutes, and the longest needle
// indicates the seconds. The clocks like the ones you can see in the picture below
// might be a real life example of a nested loop. What do you think? The first and
// outside loop would be the second’s needle, which after first completion moves the
// inside loop: minute’s needle. Then, after minute’s needle first completion, we
// moves the hour needle, which loops inside minute loop.
// Your 'C' program will take start and end time from user in an analog format and your 
// challenge is to design a digital clock that will display Hours, Minutes and Seconds on a console 
// from user provided start and end time. The program sample input/output will be as follows:
// Sample Input:
// Enter Small Needle : 10
// Enter large Needle: 12
// Enter largest Needle: 07
// Sample Output:
// 10: 00: 35
// 2021
